# Workspace Overview

This workspace is structured to support a Python-based machine learning or deep learning project, leveraging PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning for model development and training. It includes configurations for various neural network architectures and setups, data handling, and optimization processes.

## Structure

The workspace is organized into several directories and files, each serving a specific purpose in the project lifecycle:

- `.dvc/`, `.dvcignore`: Directories and files related to Data Version Control (DVC), used for managing and versioning datasets and machine learning models.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore.
- `.vscode/`: Contains Visual Studio Code settings specific to this project.
- `config/`: Houses YAML configuration files for different models and experiments.
- `data/`: Intended for storing datasets used in the project.
- `models/`: Contains Python scripts for model definitions and training routines.
- `optimization/`, `results/`: Directories for storing optimization processes and final results respectively.
- `setup.py`: A setup script for installing the project as a package.
- `stitching/`, `utils/`: Include utility scripts and modules for data processing, model loading, and other helper functions.

## Key Components

- **Model Definitions and Training**: The `models/` directory contains scripts like `models/definitions/vit.py` and `models/train.py` for defining and training neural network models.
- **Configuration Management**: Various YAML files in the `config/` directory allow for flexible configuration of models and experiments.
- **Data Processing and Visualization**: The `stitching/` directory, with scripts like `stitching/create_calculation_databases.py`, handles data processing and preparation for visualization.

## Installation

To set up this project, ensure you have Python and PyTorch installed, then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and install Python dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Set up DVC for data and model versioning as needed.

## Usage

Usage instructions vary depending on the specific task or experiment. Generally, you would:

1. Configure your experiment using the YAML files in the `config/` directory.
2. Run model training or data processing scripts, adjusting parameters as necessary.
3. Analyze results in the `results/` directory or through generated visualizations.
